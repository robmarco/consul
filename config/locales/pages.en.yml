          The new Open Government Portal is divided in three parts: Participation, Transparency and Open Data (you can see the links in the upper right-hand part).
          >**I. Participation:** In this part we can decide which city we want (using citizen proposals, debate areas, participatory budgets , collaborative legislation, and many others we will implement).
          **II. Transparency:** In this part information about how Madrid is managed will be published every day: name, position, salary, contracts, agenda,... of the persons in charge. It is also the place where exercise your right to access information, having the chance to request any information about Madrid City Council easily and rapidly.
          **III. Open data:** In this part the city council databases are posted, so that anyone can use information directly, without having to ask. It can also be requested the publication of more databases.

          We have opened the new Participation portal and we will open the new Transparency and Open Data seccion shortly (meanwhile the links to existing sites are kept).
          ## <a id='i'></a> I. Participation
          The participation section will have different ways to participate: citizen proposals, debate areas, participatory budgets , collaborative legislation, and many others. You can currently visit the debate area and the citizen proposals will be ready very soon.
          ## <a id='i1'></a>I.I. Debates area
          In the debates area everyone can open a discussion thread about any topic, creating an independent space where people could debate about the proposed topic. In this way, in this digital space there will be hundreds of different debate spaces which citizens could see, joining the ones they find more interesting.

          Both threads and comments could be valued by anyone, so the citizenship, and not someone in its name, will decide which are the most important issues in every moment. These will be showed in the main page of the space, being able to access also the rest of issues in following pages, or using others order criteria (the most commented, the newst, the most controversial, etc.).

          Every city council employee has its own user, which will be designated as such, allowing them to participate in debates at the same level than the rest of citizens. That will allow creating direct communication spaces between them, avoiding the problems that implies the measured communication, and following clear approach of the new Madrid City Council by virtue of which the city council works for the citizenship.
          ## <a id='i2'></a> I.I. Proposals area
          In the proposals area everyone can propose an initiative with the intention of collecting support enough for the idea being consulting to the whole citizenship with binding effect.

          The proposals can be supported by every citizen registered in Madrid that has verified their account in the participation platform. In this way, the citizenship, and not someone in its name, will decide which are the proposals that are worthwhile to carry out.

          One that the proposal has achive support of 2% Madrid census (arround 53000 people), it will be studied by a city council group and to move beyond the popular referendum phase, in which Madrid citizenship will vote if it is carried out or not. The maximum period to obtain support enough is 12 months.
